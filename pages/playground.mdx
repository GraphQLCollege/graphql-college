# Playground

Are you an active learner, who prefers to get your hands dirty instead of reading through a bunch of documentation? Then you've come to the right place!

## Query JSON using GraphQL

Enter any JSON data. See the auto-generated schema. Query it using GraphiQL.

This is a great way to learn how to send GraphQL queries. It's also a nice way to get a feel of GraphQL schemas and types.

## Build your own burger üçî using GraphQL

Why choose between learning GraphQL and ordering a burger? You can do both at the same time!

How do you like your patty? Choose between single, double, triple meat or chicken. Are you a vegetarian/vegan? You can replace meat with saut√©ed vegetables or mushrooms.

Choose between a regular bun or a sesame bun.

There's also plenty of different toppings that you can add to your burger. Cheese, cheddar, egg, lettuce, tomato or bacon. You can pick as many toppings as you'd like. Yummy, right? :p
